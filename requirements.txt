# Python dependencies for Road-Anomaly-Detection (TFLite + OpenCV pipeline)
# Notes:
#  - On Raspberry Pi, prefer installing `tflite-runtime` using a platform wheel (see TF Lite docs)
#  - `opencv-python` wheels are large and may not exist for ARM; on Pi install `python3-opencv` via apt
#    or use `opencv-python-headless` if GUI features aren't needed.

numpy>=1.21
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.5.64
Pillow>=9.0
psutil>=5.9
requests>=2.28

# Optional / platform-specific (commented): uncomment and install only if wheels are available
# tflite-runtime==2.11.0
